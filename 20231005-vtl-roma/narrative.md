# VTL Workshop Rome

## Trevas presentation storytelling

### Introduction

See [Reveal slides](slides.html)

### Demo

Start on [Trevas web site](http://trevas.info/) and specifically on the [overview](http://trevas.info/introduction/#trevas-ecosystem)

--> short description of Trevas: Java engine, based on ANTLR, browse through coverage pages

--> Trevas is a Java library and can be used in Java application by just declaring a dependency, but we offer also different clients to use it

--> at a low level, an API allows to use the Trevas engine in a client/server context, one example is Trevas Lab

Move to Trevas Lab

--> short tour of Trevas Lab: show script, visualize tables (different formats) (TODO: prepare script)

--> don't launch script for now, we will do that later, first have a look at another environment where Trevas can be used

Move to Trevas Notebook

--> module that can be plugged in a Jupyter environement

--> allows to execute multilanguage scripts

--> show example script and pipeline

Move to Trevas Lab

--> now let's return to our script in Trevas Lab, but first say a word of Trevas Batch in order to understand how the script executes

--> Trevas Batch useful to run VTL scripts in production environments

--> in particular, Trevas Batch produces reports that give insight into calculations

Move to report in HackMD

--> comment metrics, insist on difference between planned and optimized execution plans

Return to Trevas Lab

--> launch script

Move to kubectl console

--> show creation and run of executors

Return to Trevas Lab

--> while script is running, describe editor (repackaged from Eurostat's, published on npm), show functionalities (highlighting, suggestion...)

Return to the [overview](http://trevas.info/introduction/#trevas-ecosystem)

--> if time permits, talk about Trevas JS and show [Storybook](https://inseefr.github.io/Trevas-JS/storybook/)
